# API / Model Layers Validation

Previously we created a POST endpoint for `POST /books` but it had an issue validating an empty field. We are going to address
that in this section.

For this we would need  to modify our models with validators for author and title as:

**app/models/books.rb**
```rb
class Book < ApplicationRecord
    validates :author, presence :true, length: {minimum:3, maximum:5}
    validates :title, presence :true, length: {minimum:3, maximum:5}
end
```

So this validator works for author and title with:
- Required
- Min length: 3
- Max length: 5

[More validators here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

**Testing with CURL request:**

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"author": "asdasdas", "title": "asdasds"}' http://localhost:3000/books

{"author":["is too long (maximum is 5 characters)"],"title":["is too long (maximum is 5 characters)"]}
```

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"author": "asdasdas"}' http://localhost:3000/books

{"author":["is too long (maximum is 5 characters)"],"title":["can't be blank","is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]}
```
