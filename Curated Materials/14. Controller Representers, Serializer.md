## Controller Representers

> Also refered as a serializer. Given a model object, it returns a formatted json data to be rendered.

Representers are just a ruby class, which takes a model object and has a method `as_json` to return the jsonified data.

**app/representers/BooksRepresenter.rb**

```rb
class BooksRepresenter

    def initialize(books)
        @books = books
    end

    def as_json
        books.map do |book|
            puts book.author.first_name
            {
                id: book.id,
                title: book.title,
                author_first_name: book.author.first_name,
                author_last_name: book.author.last_name,
                author_name: author_name(book),
                author_age: book.author.age
            }
        end
    end

    private

    attr_reader :books

    def author_name(book)
        "#{book.author.first_name} #{book.author.last_name}"
    end

end
```

And we can use that representer in our controller as:

```rb
module  Api
  module V1
    class BooksController < ApplicationController

      def index
        books = Book.all
        render json: BooksRepresenter.new(books).as_json
      end
      
      ....
      ....
    end
  end
end
```

If we try getting all the books, it will still return an error cause we have some books that doesnt have author i.e. `author_id` is nil.
So, let's find our to see what's there in the database.

> rails c

```sh
# select book whose author_id is nil
irb(main):001:0> Book.select {|book| book.author_id.nil?}
   (1.3ms)  SELECT sqlite_version(*)
  Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books"
=> [#<Book id: 3, title: "asd", created_at: "2023-03-14 10:04:56.112284000 +0000", updated_at: "2023-03-14 10:04:56.112284000 +0000", author_id: nil>]

# delete each of those books
irb(main):003:0> Book.select {|book| book.author_id.nil?}.map(&:destroy)
  Book Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books"
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  Book Destroy (0.5ms)  DELETE FROM "books" WHERE "books"."id" = ?  [["id", 3]]
  TRANSACTION (6.5ms)  commit transaction
=> [#<Book id: 3, title: "asd", created_at: "2023-03-14 10:04:56.112284000 +0000", updated_at: "2023-03-14 10:04:56.112284000 +0000", author_id: nil>]
```

Now let's try sending the get request:

``curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books``

```json
[{"id":4,"title":"Harr","author_first_name":"JK","author_last_name":"Rowling","author_name":"JK Rowling","author_age":55}]
```
