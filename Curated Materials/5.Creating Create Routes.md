## Routes for POST request

So far we have created a resource with GET request only: `GET /api/books`

So, we need to extend the controller and routes to accept the POST request.

**config/routes.rb**
```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # resources :books, only: :index ----> X
  resources :books, only: [:index, :create]
end
```

With this new resource route gets added:
> rails routes
```
   POST   /books(.:format)  books#create
```

But we dont have a controller for it. We extend the **app/controllers/books_controller.rb** with **create method**
and for parameter evaluation we need to set book_params.

Here book params permits only the fields that were listed or permitted by this method

> Note: this is not a validation. 

```rb
class BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render json: Book.all
  end

  def create
    book = Book.new(book_params)
    if book.save
      render json: book, status: :created
    else
      render json: book.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  def book_params
    params.require(:book).permit(:title, :author)
  end
end

```

**Now testing with curl**

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"author": "Foo Author", "title": "asd"}' http://localhost:3000/books

{"id":3,"title":"asd","author":"Foo Author","created_at":"2023-03-14T10:04:56.112Z","updated_at":"202
```

We see that the resource created being returned.

Now, the problem with this is:

```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"author": "Foo Author"}' http://localhost:3000/books

```

In the above request, we dont need title of the book. That's the problem. Now
we need to address it in next module/section.
