# Adding a DELETE / destroy routes

Let's start by telling the ROR that we want to have a destroy resource route.

**config/routes.rb**
```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #resources :books, only: [:index, :create]
    resources :books, only: [:index, :create, :destroy]
end
```

Now we need to add a method handler for that route

**app/controllers/books_controller.rb**
```rb
class BooksController < ApplicationController
    .....
    .....

    def destroy
        Book.find(params[:id]).destroy!
        head :no_content
    end

    ....
    ....
end
```

**Test**

```sh
curl --request DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/2
```

Books gets deleted. But the issue with our handler is:
Calling this endpoint again gives an exception. Which we'll handle in next session.
